\section{Academic Projects}
\subsection{Main Project}
\cvitem{Title}{\emph{Intelligent Traffic Lights Based on RFID}}
\cvitem{Description}{The project was to implement a dynamic traffic signaling system based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The RFID readers located at the intersections of roads detect RFID tags fixed in every vehicle. By this, one can determine the count of vehicles in the waiting queue of each lane and thus dynamically compute the time for which the lane is signaled green. The system also allows assigning priority to vehicles and also tracing vehicles in cases of theft or traffic rule violation.}
\subsection{Mini Project}
\cvitem{Title}{\emph{Single Sign-On}}
\cvitem{Description}{The project was to implement single sign on for managing multiple personal accounts of users. This is a website where one can save his login credentials for different sites, and later login to each of them without the need to re-enter the login details.}
